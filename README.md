# Crop-Recommendation-AI-Device-CRAD-
The **Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD)**, built on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, is a technological marvel designed to **revolutionize precision agriculture**. This device's primary function is to recommend suitable crops based on land criteria and predicted rainfall, making it a vital tool for optimizing agricultural practices.

The hardware components of the device include the **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, a 5-in-1 soil sensor, **and** a 5-inch touchscreen**. The sensor communicates with the system via a **MAX485 TTL** to **RS485 module**, and the wiring details are seamlessly orchestrated to connect all the components effectively. An integrated touchscreen provides real-time display of the parameters, enhancing the user interaction with the device.

Data management and machine learning are at the heart of this device. The dataset utilized consists of columns for **N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and label**. The device employs a **Random Forest Classifie**r for crop recommendations, trained on 2201 records. This use of Artificial Intelligence allows the device to provide highly accurate crop recommendations, tailored to the specific conditions of the land.

The user interface is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. The touchscreen interface displays real-time parameters when the sensor is inserted into the soil, and two buttons, '**Predict**' and '**Reset**', provide user control over the system. The 'Predict' button triggers the machine learning model to recommend suitable crops, while the 'Reset' button reloads data and resets the system, ensuring it is ready for the next use.

The 5-in-1 soil sensor measures pH, NPK, temperature, humidity, and conductivity, providing comprehensive data for crop recommendation. The milliseconds delay for loading parameters into the system ensures real-time data accuracy, while the user-friendly interface allows users to easily interact with the system.

In terms of meteorological forecasting, the device integrates a 3-month average of predicted rainfall. This feature enhances the accuracy of the crop recommendations, taking into account expected rainfall in addition to the real-time soil parameters.

From a user experience perspective, this device offers numerous benefits. It allows users to easily understand and interact with the system and provides crop recommendations based on real-time land parameters and forecasted rainfall. It enables early identification of suitable crops, optimizing agricultural practices, and offers technical insights for users seeking advanced functionality.

In conclusion, the **Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD)** is a sophisticated piece of technology that combines **hardware components, data management, Artificial Intelligence, user interface design, meteorological forecasting, and user experience considerations to provide a comprehensive solution for precision agriculture.**

**APPENDIX**

- **The N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and label** columns in the dataset correspond to different parameters of the soil and weather conditions. N, P, K refer to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in the soil, respectively. Temperature and humidity are self-explanatory, pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, and rainfall refers to the amount of rainfall. The 'label' column contains the crop recommendations based on these parameters.
- **The MAX485 TTL to RS485 module** plays a crucial role in sensor communication. It converts the signal from the sensor into a format that the Raspberry Pi can understand and process. This is critical for the device to read and interpret the soil and weather data correctly.
- **The RandomForestClassifier** is a machine learning model used for providing crop recommendations. It works by creating a 'forest' of decision trees based on the dataset and then outputs the mode of the classes (crop recommendations) of the individual trees. This method allows for more accurate and reliable recommendations.
- The method for **predicting a 3-month average of rainfall** for meteorological forecasting uses historical weather data and statistical models to predict future rainfall. This information is vital for recommending crops that will thrive under the expected weather conditions.
- The **milliseconds delay** in loading parameters into the system is significant as it ensures data accuracy. This brief delay allows the system to process the real-time data from the sensor effectively, ensuring that the crop recommendations are based on the most accurate and up-to-date information.
