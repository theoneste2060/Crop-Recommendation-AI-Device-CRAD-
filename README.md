# Project Proposal: Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD)
## 1. Executive Summary
 
Agriculture in Rwanda is a cornerstone of the economy, contributing approximately 31% to the national GDP and employing about 70% of the population [1]. However, despite its significance, the sector faces challenges in optimizing crop yield, primarily due to the lack of precise information on suitable crops for specific land and weather conditions [2]. To address this problem, we propose the introduction of the Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD), an innovative solution designed to provide tailored crop recommendations based on real-time land parameters and forecasted rainfall.

CRAD presents a groundbreaking approach to optimize agricultural crop production in Rwanda by leveraging soil parameters and weather factors to offer personalized recommendations to farmers [3]. In a country where agriculture plays such a pivotal role in livelihoods, enhancing productivity is crucial [1]. Rwanda's agriculture sector faces multifaceted challenges, including climate change-induced weather variability and limited access to modern agricultural technologies and practices, which threaten food security and highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions [2].

CRAD aims to address these challenges by offering personalized crop recommendations based on soil parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and pH levels, as well as weather factors like humidity, temperature, and rainfall. By providing farmers with actionable insights, CRAD facilitates optimized resource management, climate resilience, and enhanced soil health. The anticipated impact of this project is a 15-20% improvement in crop yield and optimized agricultural practices in Rwanda over the next five years [4]. Moreover, the implementation of CRAD is expected to foster knowledge transfer and capacity building among farmers, empowering them to make informed decisions and improve productivity on their farms.

Importantly, CRAD is tailor-made for Rwanda's unique agricultural landscape, filling a gap left by previous generic crop recommendation systems [5]. By offering localized solutions that consider Rwanda's specific soil and climatic conditions, CRAD has the potential to significantly increase food productivity, contribute to food security, and improve the livelihoods of Rwandan farmers.

In conclusion, the CRAD project represents a promising opportunity to revolutionize agriculture in Rwanda. By integrating CRAD into agricultural practices, Rwanda can unlock its agricultural potential, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and foster sustainable economic development.

## 2. Project Background
 
In Rwanda, agriculture is the backbone of the economy, engaging approximately 70% of the population in agricultural activities, according to data from the Rwanda Agriculture Board (RAB) [Rwanda Agriculture Board. (n.d.)]. This sector's significance is paramount, as it sustains livelihoods and contributes significantly to the nation's food production and security [United Nations Development Programme. (2020)].

However, Rwandan farmers face daunting challenges, particularly exacerbated by climate change. Irregular rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts adversely affect crop yields, water availability, and soil fertility, hindering productivity [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. (2021)]. Additionally, limited access to modern agricultural technologies and practices further impedes progress. Many farmers rely on traditional methods and lack access to essential tools, seeds, and fertilizers [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. (2021)]. Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure, such as roads and storage facilities, poses challenges to transporting and preserving agricultural produce, impacting farmers' access to markets and the quality of their products [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. (2021)].

Despite these hurdles, efforts to enhance agricultural productivity are underway. Initiatives by the Rwandan government and various organizations focus on promoting climate-smart agriculture, improving access to modern technologies and inputs, and investing in infrastructure development [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. (2021)]. However, there remains an unmet need for precision farming solutions tailored to Rwanda's unique soil and climatic conditions [Rwanda Agriculture Board. (2019); Rurangwa, E., & Van Ranst, E. (2006)].

This gap presents an opportunity for localized solutions like the Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD), which can leverage soil parameters and weather factors to provide tailored recommendations for optimal crop selection and management. By integrating technology like CRAD into agricultural practices in Rwanda, the sector can enhance productivity, resilience, and sustainability, ultimately contributing to food security and economic development.

## 3. Problem Statement:

Rwanda's agricultural sector, which engages approximately 70% of the population, faces significant challenges that hinder productivity and threaten food security [1]. Climate change-induced weather variability, including irregular rainfall patterns and prolonged droughts, adversely affects crop yields, water availability, and soil fertility [2]. Limited access to modern agricultural technologies and practices further compounds these challenges, as many farmers rely on traditional methods and lack essential tools, seeds, and fertilizers [2]. Additionally, inadequate infrastructure such as roads and storage facilities poses challenges to transporting and preserving agricultural produce, impacting farmers' access to markets and reducing the quality and value of their products [2].

The current state of Rwandan agriculture underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions to address these multifaceted challenges and enhance agricultural productivity. The proposed implementation of the Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD) aims to tackle these issues by providing tailored crop recommendations based on soil parameters and weather factors. By leveraging technology and data-driven insights, CRAD seeks to optimize resource management, enhance climate resilience, improve soil health, and empower farmers with knowledge and skills to adapt to changing environmental conditions.

In conclusion, the **Crop Recommendation AI Device (CRAD)** is a sophisticated piece of technology that combines **hardware components, data management, Artificial Intelligence, user interface design, meteorological forecasting, and user experience considerations to provide a comprehensive solution for precision agriculture.**
  
**APPENDIX**
 
- **The N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall, and label** columns in the dataset correspond to different parameters of the soil and weather conditions. N, P, K refer to nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in the soil, respectively. Temperature and humidity are self-explanatory, pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil, and rainfall refers to the amount of rainfall. The 'label' column contains the crop recommendations based on these parameters.
- **The MAX485 TTL to RS485 module** plays a crucial role in sensor communication. It converts the signal from the sensor into a format that the Raspberry Pi can understand and process. This is critical for the device to read and interpret the soil and weather data correctly.
- **The RandomForestClassifier** is a machine learning model used for providing crop recommendations. It works by creating a 'forest' of decision trees based on the dataset and then outputs the mode of the classes (crop recommendations) of the individual trees. This method allows for more accurate and reliable recommendations.
- The method for **predicting a 3-month average of rainfall** for meteorological forecasting uses historical weather data and statistical models to predict future rainfall. This information is vital for recommending crops that will thrive under the expected weather conditions.
- The **milliseconds delay** in loading parameters into the system is significant as it ensures data accuracy. This brief delay allows the system to process the real-time data from the sensor effectively, ensuring that the crop recommendations are based on the most accurate and up-to-date information.
